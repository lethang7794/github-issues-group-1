## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed:

- [x] The user can enter a repository in a search bar, click "search", and see the associated issues. The repository should be of the format `owner/repo-name`, e.g. `facebook/react`.
- [x] If the repository does not exist, the user should see a proper error message.
- [x] The user should be able to see the following information for each issue:
  - Issue Title with Number of the issue
  - Owner of the Issue
  - Owner Avatar
  - How long ago the issue was updated in a human-friendly format (e.g. 2 days ago) (Hint: [react-moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment#installing))
  - Body of the Issue
  - Labels of the issue
- [x] The user should be able to see multiple pages of results, by clicking a pagination control.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] The user can see more details (**[including 5 comments of the issue](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments/)**) in a modal that's opened by clicking on the title of the issue.
- [x] The user should be able to see the body of the issue rendered in markdown. (Hint: [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown))
- [x] Fetching is an asynchronous operation, so you should display a loading [spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners) whenever the app loads data, and hide it once the corresponding API call has been completed.
- [x] Input Fuzzy Matching: the user should be able to type in either https://github.com/facebook/react or facebook/react, BOTH should work.
- [ ] In the Issue Detail Modal, let implement an **infinite pagination** with a "Show More" button: Fetch 5 more comments whenever user clicks on the button. The button is disabled or hidden when all the comments have been loaded.
- [ ] Users can create a new issue. (**Danger Warning**: If you attempt this task, please do so on a private repository. Don't spam the official facebook/react repo!)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Change label's text color depends on background color.
